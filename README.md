# AngularStructureProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Generating A Routing Module
By using command line parameter --routing weâ€™re able to specify that a routing module should be added to the Angular application which is being generated:

`$ ng new [name] --routing`

## Selecting A Styling Variant
By default Angular CLI generates a CSS file for every component which is added to the project. By using option --style you can change to other CSS preprocessors like you can see in the following:

`$ ng new [name] --style=scss`
